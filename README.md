# Android Bookmark Share Uploader

This repo will contain an Android app that receives browser share intents (URLs) and uploads them to a bookmark API.

## Docs
- See `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Next step
Once you confirm:
- API base URL + endpoint path
- auth approach (static token vs pairing)
- whether LAN (http) is allowed

…I’ll scaffold the Android project (Kotlin) with the share intent receiver + background upload queue.
